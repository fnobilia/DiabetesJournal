# DiabetesJournal

Diabetic people of type 1 have to register their Glycaemia value at least 4 times per day. Aim of this Android application is to substitute the outdated paper based journal.

Patients can easily
 - register their levels of Glycaemia and the Insulin.
 - check Glycaemia value daily and monthly average of Insulin thanks to two charts
 - extracting data in a PDF file
 - set up an emergency phone number
